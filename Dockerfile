# Set the mongod configuration. Ideally, I'd just like to change the database
# directory setting and maybe the logging directory settings, and leave mongo's
# defaults, presumably good settings, as is. Those may change with new mongo
# releases, but since we are copying an entire configuration file, we won't get
# those presumably new general purpose optimal settings. Also, this means there
# is the potential to fail if the older mongod.conf file here disagrees with
# some new update to how the files are interpreted or what is required in them.
# If mongod fails to start, get the original mongod.conf file, and manually make
# changes that matter for us, copy that to the docker build context (where you
# find this file), and rebuild the container

# Inside nginx-conf/ is a conf.d/ directory and inside that is the server

ADD nginx-conf/ /etc/nginx/

# Default nginx config only specs one worker process, probably all that we'll
# ever need, but lets switch it to 10 so we can actually handle a burst of

# Add a user with normal user level privs to this container. The UID can be
# changed on the command line for the build with --build-arg UID=$UID to make
# it match YOUR user id on the system you are building on. Then, host
# directories can be shared between the container and the host with -v on the
# docker run command line and you can write files from inside the container to
# the host. For reasons I don't understand, there are permission problems
# even if that directory is mode 777 on the host, unless the user id running
# inside the container matches the user id on the host that executed docker run

###### SETUP the mongo database directory ######

# Make the mongodb database directory and lets try to keep all our shit inside
# our play space, the /home/variant-server directory. So mongodb's files will
# live in there. 
RUN mkdir /home/variant-server/database

# Because we might have a live and development version, or a running version
# and then we are going to update to a new release and want to save the
# previously working mongo database, create a directory which we will call
# "initial" here, and make a symlink from "live" to initial. The mongod.conf
# configuration file will point mongod server to /home/variant-server/database/live
# as its database location. If we drop a new one in there, under a different name
# preferably with a date (I don't know how to get today's date inside this file)
# to make the pivot we just briefly stop mongod, change the symlink, and restart
# mongod. Test the server. If everything works, great. If not, switch it back, and
# start scratching our heads. Go build another container on another host and
# figure it out there.
RUN mkdir /home/variant-server/database/initial
RUN ln -s /home/variant-server/database/initial /home/variant-server/database/live

# We'll also direct mongod to write its logs and problems into our play space
RUN mkdir /home/variant-server/database/logs

# The server serves HTTP/HTTPS so it needs those ports open, and mongo
# might be needed from the host or at least most convenient that way. It is up
# to the user to make sure access to the exposed mongo port is restricted
# from the internet by the host's firewall and forwarding rules, or docker
# run port mappings
EXPOSE 80 443 27017

# We will not download and install a database unless explicitly requested
# this will take a long time otherwise. Use --build-arg DOWNLOAD=yes to
# pull the latest snapshot of the lab's variant server mongodb database to
# the image build and load mongo inside the image.
#
# NOTE: You may instead want the mongo database data itself to live outside
#       the docker image on the host filesystem and share the mongo database
#       directory with the container with -v on the docker run command line
#
# WARNING: You may run into problems building the container due to the payload
#          pacticularly on Macs where the workspace docker has for building
#          images does have a limit that can only be extended through some
#          manual crap. Thus the build of this image w/ download may fail
#          due to this. That can happen on Linux too.
# Please see https://forums.docker.com/t/no-space-left-on-device-error/10894/33
# for more information if you see "no space left on device" and failure at this
# step.
#
# This command will remove exited containers:
#    docker rm $(docker ps -q -f 'status=exited')
# This command will remove "dangling" images - images not needed for anything
#    docker rmi $(docker images -q -f "dangling=true")
# Doing both will clear out some of your docker build workspace

# NOT USING THIS AT THE MOMENT

#
# This is sort of more complicated than doable in RUN commands, so its in a
# shell script. BUT - THERE IS GOOD REASON NOT TO DO THIS INSIDE THE CONTAINER HERE.
# please see the shell script comments for why this should eventually be
# commented out here, and you should run the script via docker run with a
# host mounted volume
# This should be run by the docker run command with a host shared directory
# for the mongo database to live in. Also, remember the container fs is
# ephemeral so when docker run finishes, all changes to within the container
# are gone, although I think you can still grab the image from an exited
# container as long as you didn't docker rm it yet.

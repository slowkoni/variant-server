# Script to download a mongo database dump and mongorestore it. This is
# difficult to generalize for another user, so sort of specific for the
# needs of the Bustamante Lab and the ClinGen project which motivated the
# development of any of this. Unless modified by a user forking the repo
# this script will pull the latest backup/dump of the mongo database from
# the live (or dev) server from S3 and unpack it. Then it will mongo restore
#
# HOWEVER: Having the Dockerfile do this from within the container is
#          probably a bad idea as this will result in the mongo database
#          full payload living inside the container image. Better practice
#          would be to mount a host directory to the container when
#          docker run is executed, and mongod inside the container pointed
#          to where that directory is mounted. This script should then be
#          run by the docker run command with the -v option to map the
#          host directory where you want the mongo database to live, to
#          /home/variant-server/database/initial. (replace initial with
#          a dated directory if you are loading up a new version from S3,
#          then update the "live" link inside the container and commit the
#          container - otherwise the live link will revert to pointing to
#          initial because that is where the docker build command will
#          point it). 
#
#          to whomever ends up with a TB sized docker image one day because
#          the mongo database is inside the container, YOU WERE WARNED!
#          (if you read comments)
